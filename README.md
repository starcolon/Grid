# Grid
Grid module for virtualization projects
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/starcolon/Grid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/starcolon/Grid)



The library is more designed in functional programming sense than an object-oriented discipline. Grid is actually a set of pure functions that manipulate generic two-dimensional arrays. The module itself does not and will not define its own data type. It just basically comprises a purely functional sets of operations.
